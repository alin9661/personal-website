# Action Required: Delete Duplicate Sidebar Component

## Files to Delete:
1. `/src/components/Layout/Sidebar.tsx` - This is a duplicate and should be removed

## Why?
- The proper Sidebar component is in `/src/features/navigation/components/Sidebar.tsx`
- Having duplicate components causes confusion and maintenance issues
- The navigation feature folder follows better feature-based architecture

## After Deletion:
- Make sure all imports reference the navigation feature component
- The Layout component already imports from the correct location
